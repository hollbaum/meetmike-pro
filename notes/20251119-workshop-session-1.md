## Raw Notes (Capturing Janus's Input)

### Initial Brain Dump (12:50-12:51 UTC)

**Project Overview:**
- 5-6 different roles for agents to perform
- Following client journey from beginning to end:
  - Finding the client
  - Leading them to website
  - Initial conversation when they arrive
  - Negotiating prices
  - Handling the problem/solution

**Action Point #1: Project Naming**
- Current name "Meet Mike" is temporary
- Need better name that reflects what we solve for clients
- Can't finalize until we define:
  - What remedies we provide
  - What we actually solve for clients
  - Key differentiators
  - Core values
  - Actual problems we solve
- Status: To be defined after clarifying value proposition
- Priority: Keep on deliverables list

**Role #1: PULSE - Lead Finding Agent**
- **Purpose:** Find leads by identifying market needs/pain points
- **Method:** Web scraping and crawling for keywords
- **Execution:** Periodic runs (hourly/12hr/24hr - TBD)
- **Process Flow:**
  1. Search internet for "desperate clients" needing solutions
  2. Identify spikes/clusters in conversations about digital problems
  3. Examples of triggers:
     - Heavy activity around "ChatGPT is not sufficient"
     - Articles about "massive shortage of translators in Germany"
  4. Analyze relevance to Meet Mike's capabilities
  5. Access company registration databases (e.g., Germany)
  6. Pull relevant client contacts/emails
  7. Send outreach: "Try Meet Mike - we might solve your problem"
  8. Direct to website
- **Development Notes:**
  - Requires significant coding/development
  - DO NOT START - need Christian's technical input first
  - API integration with company registration databases needed
- **Core Function:** Identify where people need consultancy for digital problems

## Session Status

**PAUSED at 13:00 UTC** - Janus needs to pick up son. Will resume later in same Teams thread.

**Captured so far:**
- Action Point #1: Project naming (pending value proposition definition)
- Role #1: PULSE (lead finding agent via web scraping)

**Next:** Continue brain dump when Janus returns.
