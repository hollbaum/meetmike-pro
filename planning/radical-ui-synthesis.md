# Meet Mike Radical UI Rethink - Team Synthesis

**Date:** 2025-12-07
**Challenge:** Move beyond chatbox widgets to immediate, instinctive engagement
**Contributors:** Codex, Gemini, Copilot (synthesized by Claude)

---

## The Problem

Standard chat widgets (bottom-right corner, 70% modal) feel like "dumb chatbot" patterns. Christian wants Meet Mike to be radically different - like Google's original homepage where the search box IS the experience, not an add-on.

**Goal:** Visitors engage with Mike IMMEDIATELY upon landing, not as an afterthought.

---

## Team Consensus (All 3 Agents Agree)

### 1. BLANK CANVAS / MINIMAL HERO
All agents independently proposed variations of "the entire page is just Mike":
- **Copilot:** 95% white space, single text field, cursor auto-focused
- **Codex:** Command palette style, Mike IS the OS-level command bar
- **Gemini:** Dynamic canvas with subtle responsiveness to user presence

**Key Insight:** No navigation, no buttons, no alternative paths. The page IS Mike.

### 2. MIKE INITIATES (Not User)
All agents proposed Mike speaking/typing first:
- **Copilot:** Typewriter effect - Mike's intro types itself
- **Codex:** Voice-first welcome with audio greeting
- **Gemini:** Interactive narrative - Mike asks provocative question, user clicks options

**Key Insight:** Mike is ACTIVE, not passive. Creates curiosity without requiring user action.

### 3. NO CHATBOX WIDGET
All agents rejected the traditional "click to chat" pattern:
- No floating icon
- No bottom-right placement
- No modal overlay feel
- Mike is CENTER STAGE, not a feature

## Unique Ideas by Agent

### From Codex
| Approach | Concept | Differentiator |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Command Palette** | ⌘K style floating bar with Mike | Feels like power tool, not bot |
| **Live Briefing Canvas** | Mike edits document as you type | Co-creation, not chat bubbles |
| **30-Second Challenge** | "Give me one task, I'll show plan" | Urgency creates immediate action |

### From Gemini
| Approach | Concept | Differentiator |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Interactive Narrative** | Mike asks first: "Market is shifting. Ready?" | Choose-your-own-adventure start |
| **Contextual Stream** | Flowing insights based on who you are | Push model (Mike demonstrates value first) |
| **Zero-UI Voice** | Audio greeting, voice-first interaction | Intimate, concierge feel |

### From Copilot
| Approach | Concept | Differentiator |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Blank Canvas** | 95% white, one field: "What's your project?" | Google homepage simplicity |
| **Typewriter Effect** | Mike's intro types letter-by-letter | Feels ALIVE, present |
| **Question Chain** | One question per screen, progressive | Typeform-style conversational |
| **Context Responder** | Interface adapts to scroll/hover | Mike "notices" your behavior |

## Key Insight

> "Traditional consulting websites feel transactional. Fill out form, get contacted. Our approaches make it feel RELATIONAL. Mike isn't a form, he's a PERSON. Visitor engages with Mike, not the website."

This is why Google works - you're not "using a website," you're asking Google a question. Similarly, Mike should BE the experience.
