Subject: [Company] + AI: A 6-month partnership idea

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because we're launching a new kind of consulting engagement - one where you don't just get strategy, you get AI coworkers you can keep.

Here's the concept:
- 6-month engagement: we help you with [their pain point: financial strategy/brand positioning/lead gen]
- During the engagement, you work WITH our AI specialists (we call them Eidolons)
- If they add value, you can lease them for $2K/month after we're done

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore if this fits [Company]'s needs?

Best,
Christian / Janus
Meet Mike

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Eidolon reliability:** Ensure robust error handling, human fallback
- **Data security:** TOME layer hardening, SOC 2 compliance planning
- **Scalability:** Infrastructure to support 50+ concurrent Eidolons
- **Integration complexity:** Standardized connectors for common tools

### Business Risks
- **Market education:** "AI coworker" is new concept, requires explanation
  - *Mitigation:* Consulting-first model validates before asking for pure product purchase
- **Competition:** Large players (OpenAI, Anthropic) could enter space
  - *Mitigation:* Deep tech differentiation (Orchestra, SAIGE, multi-model)
- **Regulatory changes:** AI regulation could impact business model
  - *Mitigation:* FAITH principles align with responsible AI, transparency built-in

### Operational Risks
- **Founder bandwidth:** Christian + Janus wearing many hats
  - *Mitigation:* Hire ops/customer success by Month 6-8
- **Cash flow:** Consulting revenue lumpy, subscriptions take time to build
  - *Mitigation:* Stagger client starts, require deposits, manage burn carefully
