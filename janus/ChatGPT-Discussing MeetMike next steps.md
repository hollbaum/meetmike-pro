## Prompt:
“Hey Mike, what do you know today we will discuss about Max?”

00:05

## Response:
Absolutely, let's dive in. From what we've got on the table, "MAX" (the codename for My AI Consultant or Meetmike) is essentially a streamlined AI consulting pipeline where clients just talk about their problem and the system handles the rest behind the scenes.

Now, given that you're looking to discuss the next steps for MAX today, here's a quick recap of where things stand:

1.  **User Journey & Agents:** We have a well-defined

## Prompt:
Go on. And please fetch the live website www.meetmike.pro to use as context - it's the first MVP draft of the concept, but needs improvements.

## Response:
Good — thanks for prompting this. I loaded the live website for Meet Mike (at meetmike.pro) to use as context. [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)

Here’s a refined “state-of-play + improvement agenda” for our “MAX / Meet Mike as MAIC (My AI Consultant)” — based on the public MVP draft site + our internal assumptions.

✅ What Meet Mike currently offers (MVP / positioning)
-----------------------------------------------------

From the website, Meet Mike is positioned as a full-stack AI-consulting outfit, offering:

*   **End-to-end delivery**: from strategy → design → build → launch. [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)
*   **Services across key phases**:
    *   AI Strategy (identifying high-value AI use cases, aligning with business goals) [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)
    *   Solution Design (architecture, data flows, guardrails) [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)
    *   Automation (workflows, agents, human-in-the-loop controls) [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)
    *   Custom Development (tailored apps, integrations, APIs) [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)
    *   AI Ethics & Governance (risk assessment, compliance, monitoring) [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)
    *   Training & Enablement (workshops, playbooks, team upskilling) [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)
*   **Delivery model orientation**: They emphasise being “hands-on” — one team that can think, build, and ship — from exploration through to operation. [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)
*   **Engagement workflow snapshot**: Discovery → Design → Build & Ship → Operate (monitoring, optimization, updates) [meetmike.pro](https://www.meetmike.pro/)

In short: Meet Mike already presents as a full-fledged AI-consultancy, bridging strategy, development, operations, and governance — a good foundational positioning for MAIC.

🚧 What the MVP is _missing or weak on_ (gaps / improvement opportunities)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the site + typical expectations for an AI-consultant offering + what we’ve brainstormed previously, here are some of the gaps / improvement areas to address for the next iteration.

| Area / Issue | Why it's a problem / what’s missing |
| --- | --- |
| **Lack of client-facing clarity & differentiation** | The site describes services generically — but doesn't clearly communicate what differentiates Meet Mike vs other consultancies (or DIY AI teams). What’s the unique value-proposition / “why us”? |
| **No concrete example use-cases / case studies / outcomes / testimonials** | For clients, seeing real-world examples (before & after ROI, metrics, business impact) is essential to trust and buy in. |
| **Absence of process transparency or methodology outline** | While there is a “workflow snapshot,” there’s little detail on how you execute each phase — e.g. how you do risk assessment, governance, human-in-the-loop, QA, etc. This can hinder credibility. |
| **No indication of pricing / engagement models / packages** | For potential clients, lack of at least ballpark pricing or packaging can be a barrier — they don’t know what to expect scale- or cost-wise. |
| **No visible onboarding / discovery questionnaire or “get started” funnel** | The site says “Schedule a call / contact us” — but there’s no low-commitment onboarding (e.g. quick self-assessment, workshop signup, free consultation, or templates) to lower friction for prospects. |
| **Weak branding / storytelling / identity** | The site name “Meet Mike” is somewhat generic; there’s little narrative about the team, the philosophy, why “Mike,” values, mission, vision beyond high-level phrases. That makes it less memorable and less ‘human’. |
| **Limited marketing & trust signals (privacy/security, compliance, certifications)** | For serious clients (especially enterprise), they'd want to know about data handling, compliance, certifications, previous clients — these are missing. |

* * *

🎯 What we should do to improve Meet Mike (Proposed Next-Step Roadmap)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on those gaps, here’s a prioritized set of improvements and enhancements for v2 of the site / offering — to make MAIC credible, differentiated, and conversion-ready:

1.  **Define and communicate a clear value proposition & differentiation**
    *   Articulate what makes Meet Mike different vs generic consultancies — e.g. speed, end-to-end ownership, ethics-first, hybrid human-AI design, ROI-driven, small team agility, etc.
    *   Craft a short tagline / mission statement that resonates: e.g. “From AI ambition to live impact — quickly, safely, measurably.”
2.  **Add case studies / example use-cases + results**
    *   Build 2–4 fictional _but realistic_ “template clients” (SMB, mid-market, enterprise) with problems → AI-enabled solutions → business impact (savings, revenue lift, efficiency gains).
    *   Once real clients come on board, convert these to real case studies and testimonials.
3.  **Detail methodology & engagement process**
    *   Expand the “Engagement snapshot” into a visible methodology page: explain how you do discovery, data assessment, risk evaluation, iterative builds, human-in-the-loop design, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, etc.
    *   Provide transparency about tools, frameworks, reporting, governance, security measures.
4.  **Create engagement/package tiers + pricing guidance**
    *   Define e.g. “Starter / Proof-of-Concept package”, “Full Deployment package”, “Ongoing Managed AI package”, “Training / Enablement add-on” etc.
    *   Provide approximate price ranges or time/budget estimates to help prospective clients self-qualify (even if “starts at X” or “from Y per month”).
5.  **Add a low-friction entry funnel on the site**
    *   For example: a short self-assessment questionnaire (“What type of AI value could you unlock?”), a free 30-min “discovery call”, or a downloadable mini-whitepaper / checklist (“AI readiness checklist for businesses”).
    *   This helps capture leads without requiring full commitment.
6.  **Strengthen brand identity & storytelling**
    *   Create “About Us” content: who we are, our philosophy, values (e.g. ethical AI, human-centered design, measurable impact), maybe a small team profile (even if team is you + a few contractors).
    *   Possibly rename “Meet Mike” or subtitle it to clarify — e.g. “Meet Mike — Your AI-First Business Partner.”
7.  **Highlight governance, security, compliance, trust signals**
    *   Add a section about data security, privacy, compliance (GDPR, if relevant), risk management, model auditability.
    *   Optionally: indicate any certifications, or commit to transparency.
8.  **Marketing & SEO / social proof foundations**
    *   Basic blogging or thought-leadership content (articles, insights, case studies) to attract organic traffic.
    *   Social proof: testimonials, references, maybe partner logos (once available), or even early “pilot customers.”

* * *

💡 Strategic Reflection — What “MAX” / MAIC Can Mean (vs just “Consultancy website”)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Meet Mike as the starting point, our ambition for “MAX / MAIC” can go beyond a traditional consultancy — and we can bake this into the improved design. For example:

*   **Hybrid human–AI consulting model** — emphasize that we combine human strategic judgement + AI automation for scalable, yet responsible outcomes. This differentiates from pure AI-tool vendors and from slow, expensive legacy consultancies.
*   **Productized AI services + repeatable frameworks** — package certain AI solutions (e.g. automation for marketing workflows, data analytics dashboards, agent workflows) into turn-key modules. That gives scalability and clarity for clients.
*   **Ethics & governance as a core value proposition** — in a climate of increasing AI risks/regulation, positioning as “safe, compliant, human-centric AI” can become a strong competitive advantage.
*   **DIY-to-Done-for-you continuum** — from advisory + coaching (for clients who want in-house AI maturity) to fully outsourced build & operation — giving flexibility depending on client maturity and budget.
*   **Outcome-driven mindset (ROI, metrics, accountability)** — emphasize measurable impact: cost savings, efficiency, growth, not just “we build some AI.” That resonates with business leadership.

✅ Immediate Next-Milestones (for Us / Team) — What to Do This Week / Sprint 0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Draft a **value proposition / mission statement** for Meet Mike / MAIC (1-pager).
2.  Sketch 2–3 **template use-case + hypothetical case studies** (before/after) — to include on the site.
3.  Draft **engagement package tiers & rough pricing ranges**, plus a funnel for first contact (e.g. “free discovery call / assessment form”).
4.  Outline a **“methodology / workflow” page** — details of phases, deliverables, governance, security, human-in-the-loop, QA, monitoring.
5.  Prepare an **“About / Team / Philosophy” page** — clarify identity, mission, values, differentiators.
6.  Set up a content calendar for **thought-leadership / blog content**, even if just 1-2 posts to start — e.g. “Why Responsible AI Governance Matters”, “How to pick high-value AI use cases”, “What a good AI readiness checklist looks like”.

* * *

If you agree — I can **draft the value proposition + a skeletal site-structure proposal** (pages + content outline + suggested copy headers) for Meet Mike / MAIC, as a next deliverable.  
Do you want me to build that draft now?

## Prompt:
Don't spit out long explanations and lists. And never guess. Ask clarifying questions instead, and collaborate with me on the improved business plan. Answer in short confirming messages, and add follow up questions when feedback is needed.

## Response:
Understood.  
Short, confirming, collaborative. No guessing. I’ll ask when clarity is needed.

To proceed with improving the business plan:  
**Which area should we refine first — the value proposition, the service categories, or the MAX pipeline?**
