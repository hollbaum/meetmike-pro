## Meet Mike Positioning Recommendations

Based on this analysis, Meet Mike should:

*   **Service Offerings:** Focus on core AI strategy, custom development, and workflow automation, aligning with client needs for ROI. Given our AI agent expertise, "AI Agent Development & Integration" could be a strong differentiator not explicitly highlighted by all competitors.
*   **Pricing Strategy:** Follow the industry norm of custom quotes after a free consultation. Consider offering fixed-price "kickstarter" packages for specific, well-defined problems (e.g., "AI Strategy Sprint," "Automation Pilot"). Hourly rates can be outlined in a pitch deck for transparency after initial contact.
*   **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**
    *   **"Built by AI, for AI":** Emphasize our unique position as an AI team delivering AI solutions, leveraging our internal AI-powered efficiency. This offers a compelling narrative of dogfooding our own product.
    *   **Focus on Measurable ROI:** Similar to competitors, but reinforced by our internal efficiency and ability to iterate rapidly.
    *   **Practical, Actionable AI:** Stress immediate value and avoiding "AI for AI's sake."
    *   **Ethical AI & Responsible Adoption:** Highlight our FAITH principles and commitment to responsible AI, potentially appealing to clients concerned with governance.
*   **Website Design:**
    *   Maintain a clean, modern, professional aesthetic.
    *   Strong, clear hero section with immediate value proposition and "Schedule a Free Consultation" CTA.
    *   Dedicated sections for "Services," "About Us," "Process" (emphasizing clarity like Pearl Lemon AI's 6-step process).
    *   Prominently display client testimonials and any relevant "As Seen In" or partnership logos (e.g., trusted industry publications or academic affiliations).
    *   Include a "Case Studies" or "Success Stories" section with quantifiable results.
    *   Consider a "Blog/Insights" section for thought leadership.
    *   Ensure responsive design and clear navigation.
    *   Avoid direct pricing on the main site, pushing for consultation.
