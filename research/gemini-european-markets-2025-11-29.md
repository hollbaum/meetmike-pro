## Conclusion:

Across Denmark, France, and Spain, SMEs are increasingly turning to AI to address critical business challenges, from optimizing maritime logistics and manufacturing processes to enhancing customer service and supporting rural economies. While there are shared pain points, particularly around skills gaps, data readiness, and cost/knowledge barriers, government initiatives and consulting firms are actively working to bridge these gaps. Tangible benefits include significant reductions in operational costs and processing times, increased efficiency and production, and improved customer satisfaction. This reinforces the strong demand and clear value proposition for AI consulting services across the European SME market.
