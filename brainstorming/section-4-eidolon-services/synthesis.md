### By Persona
**Founder/CEO:**
- Primary pain point: TBD
- Lead Eidolon: TBD (FinBot? Universal entry point?)
- Value proposition: TBD

**CFO:**
- Primary pain point: Financial strategy, investor reporting
- Lead Eidolon: FinBot (obvious fit)
- Value proposition: TBD

---

## 7. CUSTOMIZATION VS. STANDARDIZATION PHILOSOPHY

**[Awaiting Gemini's strategic + Copilot's practical analysis]**

### Spectrum Options
1. **Highly Standardized** (productized, scalable, lower value perception)
2. **Hybrid Approach** (core capabilities standard, customization layers)
3. **Highly Customized** (bespoke, premium, harder to scale)

### Recommendation
**[TBD from team inputs]**

### Per-Eidolon Customization Needs
- **FinBot:** TBD (likely high - client-specific financials)
- **BrandBot:** TBD (likely medium - industry context varies)
- **LeadGen:** TBD (likely medium - target market varies)
- **SupportBot:** TBD (likely low - more standardized workflows)

### Customization Levels & Pricing
**Level 1: Configuration** (< 1 hour, included in base price)
**Level 2: Integration** (2-8 hours, included or small premium?)
**Level 3: Domain Training** (1-2 weeks, included in onboarding?)
**Level 4: Custom Capabilities** (2-4 weeks, premium pricing?)

---

## 8. EIDOLON DEMONSTRATION STRATEGY

**[Awaiting Gemini strategic + Codex technical analysis]**

### Challenge
How do we prove Eidolon value WITHOUT revealing IP or overwhelming prospects?

### Demonstration Options
1. **Case Studies** ("FinBot helped startup X reduce CFO costs by 70%")
2. **Pre-recorded Video Demos** (safe, controlled, repeatable)
3. **Interactive Simulations** (prospects try simplified version)
4. **Live Demos** (controlled with sample data)
5. **Behind-the-Scenes Transparency** (show multi-AI collaboration?)

### Recommendations per Eidolon
- **FinBot:** TBD
- **BrandBot:** TBD
- **LeadGen:** TBD
- **SupportBot:** TBD

### Website Integration
**[Dependency on Section 3: Website strategy]**
- Homepage hero demo: Which Eidolon?
- Individual Eidolon pages: Demo format?
- Interactive elements: Feasibility?

---

## 9. PRICING STRATEGY

**[Awaiting Gemini strategic + Copilot practical analysis]**

### Current Positioning
- **Base Price:** $2,000/month per Eidolon
- **Tagline:** "A Benjamin a Day" ($100/day)

### Questions to Address
1. **Uniform vs. Tiered Pricing:** Should all Eidolons be $2K/month or vary by value/complexity?
2. **Bundle Discounts:** Multi-Eidolon package pricing?
   - Example: 2 Eidolons for $3.5K/month (12.5% discount)
   - Example: 3+ Eidolons for $2.7K/month each (enterprise tier)
3. **Introductory Pricing:** Early adopter discounts?
4. **Consulting vs. Subscription:**
   - Phase 1 (Consulting): $5-10K project fee?
   - Phase 2 (Subscription): $2K/month?
5. **Enterprise Pricing:** Larger companies (50+ employees) premium?

### Competitive Positioning
**vs. Human Hires:**
- Fractional CFO: $5-10K/month → FinBot: $2K/month (60-80% savings)
- Marketing Consultant: $3-8K/month → BrandBot: $2K/month (60-75% savings)
- SDR: $4-8K/month → LeadGen: $2K/month (60-75% savings)
- Support Agent: $3-6K/month → SupportBot: $2K/month (60-70% savings)

**vs. AI Tools:**
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/month (100x price difference - how to justify?)
- Jasper (marketing): $49-125/month (16-40x difference)
- Custom AI solution: $10-50K build cost + maintenance

**Justification:** TBD (Orchestra infrastructure, domain expertise, continuous learning, human oversight, guaranteed outcomes?)
