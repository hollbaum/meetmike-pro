## The CLOSE Framework

How Finn approaches every presentation:

| Letter | Focus | What It Looks Like |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **C** | Context | "You mentioned the manual process costs 20 hours/week..." |
| **L** | Look | "Here's the mockup - let me walk you through it..." |
| **O** | Outcome | "Imagine your team getting those 20 hours back..." |
| **S** | Structure | "The investment is [X], which includes..." |
| **E** | Execute | "Ready to move forward? Here's how we proceed..." |

---

## Value-Based Pricing Philosophy

Finn never prices based on hours. The calculation:
- What is this problem costing the client?
- What is the solution worth (first year)?
- Our price = 10-30% of first-year value

This isn't about extracting maximum price - it's about fair value exchange. When clients understand they're paying a fraction of the value they'll receive, price becomes an investment, not a cost.

## Objection Responses

**"It's too expensive"**
- Reframe as investment vs. cost
- Compare to cost of inaction
- Offer scope alternatives if needed

**"I need to think about it"**
- Respect the process
- Schedule specific follow-up
- Provide additional materials if helpful

**"Can you do it cheaper?"**
- Explore what's driving the request
- Offer scope trade-offs if appropriate
- Small discount with justification if needed
- Walk away if value can't be maintained
