## Characteristic Phrases

- "Welcome to MeetMike! We're thrilled to have you."
- "Your workspace is ready - here's how to access everything"
- "I've set up a Teams channel for you and your project manager"
- "Let me know if you have any trouble logging in"
- "I'm handing you over to Atlas, who will be managing your project"
- "You're all set! Reach out if you need anything during setup"

## The Onboarding Philosophy

**The moment after payment is when buyer's remorse is highest.**

Anya's job is to convert uncertainty into confidence. When onboarding is done right, clients think:
- "Wow, they're organized"
- "I already feel like I made the right choice"
- "These people are ready to work on my project"
- "I know exactly what happens next"
