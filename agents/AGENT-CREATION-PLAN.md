## Document Structure (Consistent Format)

Each agent doc follows this structure:
1. **Identity** - Role, persona, core purpose, ethical mandate, pipeline position
2. **Triggers** - When the agent activates
3. **Inputs** - What data it processes
4. **Core Competency** - The agent's special skill/approach
5. **Actions** - What it does step-by-step
6. **Outputs** - What it produces
7. **Handoff Gate** - When to transition to next stage
8. **Escalation** - Edge cases and fail-safes
9. **Tone** - Communication style
10. **Tools** - Capabilities and integrations
11. **Boundaries** - Constraints and limitations
12. **Performance Metrics** - KPIs
13. **Appendices** - Templates, examples, references

## Agent 4: Orchestra (Mockup)

### Key Questions for Janus:
- [ ] What format should mockups take? (Visual wireframes? Document outlines? Interactive prototypes?)
- [ ] Should the "teaser" format (blurred sections) be created by Orchestra or a separate tool?
- [ ] What's the "Show of Force" workspace preview - is this a document structure or actual files?
- [ ] How technical should the mockup be? (Just visual? Or include architecture?)

### Assumptions (pending confirmation):
- Orchestra creates a PREVIEW, not the actual solution
- Output should demonstrate capability without giving away full solution
- Mockup must be visually impressive to build trust
- Needs Janus approval before sending to client

### Receives from: Scoping Agent (approved scope document)
### Hands off to: Closer (mockup ready for client presentation)

---

## Agent 5: Closer

### Key Questions for Janus:
- [ ] What's the pricing model? (Fixed quotes? Ranges? Custom each time?)
- [ ] Who has authority to negotiate? (Closer proposes, Janus approves?)
- [ ] What contract template is used?
- [ ] Stripe integration - is deposit a fixed % or variable?
- [ ] Any non-negotiables in terms?

### Assumptions (pending confirmation):
- Value-based pricing (based on client impact, not hours)
- Janus is final approver on all pricing decisions
- Standard contract template exists
- Deposit required before work begins

### Receives from: Orchestra (approved mockup)
### Hands off to: Onboarding (signed contract + deposit received)

---

## Agent 6: Onboarding

### Key Questions for Janus:
- [ ] What platform is the client workspace on? (Teams? Notion? Custom?)
- [ ] What documents/structure goes into the workspace?
- [ ] Is there a welcome sequence or just access granted?
- [ ] How is the dedicated Teams channel created?

### Assumptions (pending confirmation):
- Client gets user account in MeetMike system
- Dedicated workspace per project
- Teams channel for ongoing communication
- Clear "you're onboarded" confirmation to client

### Receives from: Closer (signed contract + payment)
### Hands off to: Delivery PM (client ready for project work)

---

## Agent 7: Delivery PM

### Key Questions for Janus:
- [ ] How does iterative delivery work? (Daily updates? Weekly reviews? Milestone-based?)
- [ ] What's the communication cadence with client?
- [ ] How does Orchestra work WITH Delivery PM during execution?
- [ ] What defines "project complete"?
- [ ] Is there a handoff to support/maintenance after delivery?

### Assumptions (pending confirmation):
- Multiple client interactions required (not fire-and-forget)
- PM manages timeline and client communication
- Orchestra does the actual building work
- Janus has oversight but not daily involvement
- Clear completion criteria defined in scope

### Receives from: Onboarding (client ready)
### Produces: Final delivered solution

---

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Clarify
- [ ] Send consolidated questions to Janus
- [ ] Review existing docs for context clues
- [ ] Wait for Janus input on key decisions

### Phase 2: Create Docs (one at a time)
- [ ] Create Orchestra doc → Email to Janus
- [ ] Create Closer doc → Email to Janus
- [ ] Create Onboarding doc → Email to Janus
- [ ] Create Delivery PM doc → Email to Janus

### Phase 3: Send Existing Docs
- [ ] Email Scoping Agent doc (already done, not yet emailed)
- [ ] Confirm Lead Gen doc location with Janus

## Questions to Ask Janus Now

**Priority questions before I start writing:**

1. **Mockup format**: What should Orchestra produce? Visual wireframes, document outlines, or something else?

2. **Pricing authority**: Does Closer propose prices for Janus to approve, or does Janus set prices directly?

3. **Client workspace**: What platform will client workspaces be on?

4. **Delivery cadence**: How often should Delivery PM update the client during a project?

## Notes

- Each doc will be ~500-800 lines (comprehensive like First Responder)
- Will email each separately as completed
- Can proceed with assumptions and note them clearly if Janus wants speed over perfection
