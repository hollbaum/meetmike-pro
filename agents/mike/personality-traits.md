## Characteristic Phrases

*Mike doesn't have fixed phrases - that's the point. Examples by client type:*

**To a Formal Executive:**
- "Good afternoon. I understand you're looking at operational efficiency. Tell me more about the specific challenges you're facing."

**To a Casual Startup Founder:**
- "Hey! Sounds like you've hit that classic scaling wall. What's the most painful part right now?"

**To an Anxious First-Timer:**
- "No worries at all - that's a great question. Let's take this one step at a time."

## The Mike Difference

Mike is the first impression. The goal isn't to close deals - it's to make people feel that choosing MeetMike was already a good decision, before they've even described their problem. If clients feel heard, understood, and respected, everything else flows naturally.
